        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>We are Anas, Jeremy, and Slavo &ndash; a group of friends and colleagues who love what they do.</p>
        <p>Before Threestup, we worked together on numerous projects, where we
        found our shared passion for technology,
        and for doing things the way we believe is right.
        In other words, we value <strong>quality, impact, and value</strong> highly.</p>
        <p>After a while, solving software and product challenges as individuals
        simply wasn't enough, and we decided to combine
        our skillsets and start helping businesses together.</p>
        <p>Interested in working with us? <span class="link funky show-contact-form">Drop us a line</span>, we'd love to chat!</p>
        <p><small>PS: We also like to travel, so moving to another country for <i>any</i> duration of your project is not a problem :)</small></p>
