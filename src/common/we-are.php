        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>We are Anas, Jeremy, and Slavo &ndash; a group of friends who love what they do.</p>
        <p>Before Threestup, we worked together on numerous projects, where we
        noticed our shared passion for technology, and for doing things well.</p>
        <p>After a short break and countless hours spent in cafes around London,
        we decided to give it a shot and started contacting people and companies
        who might need help solving software and product challenges.</p>
        <p>If you are one of them, <span class="link funky show-contact-form">drop us a line</span>, we'd love to chat!</p>
        <p><small>PS: We also like to travel, so moving to another country for <i>any</i> duration of your project is not a problem :)</small></p>
