        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>We are Anas, Jeremy, and Slavo &ndash; a group of friends who love what they do.</p>
        <p>Before Threestup, we worked together on numerous projects, where we
        found our shared passion for technology,
        and for doing things the way we believe is right.
        In other words, we value <strong>quality, impact, and value.</strong></p>
        <p>After a short break and countless hours spent
        in cafes around London, we decided to start helping companies
        solve software and product challenges together.</p>
        <p>If you are one of them, <span class="link funky show-contact-form">drop us a line</span>, we'd love to chat!</p>
        <p><small>PS: We also like to travel, so moving to another country for <i>any</i> duration of your project is not a problem :)</small></p>
